Installation

You need a few other packages, including the devtools package (which may take a while to install). Run <a href="https://github.com/david-borchers/hmltm/blob/master/inst/installscript.r" rel="nofollow">this script</a> to install.

Getting Started
===============

The files 'hmltmExercise.pdf' and 'hmltmExercise_solution.pdf' in the vignettes folder contain exercises and solutions from an online workshop in 2022 that are designed to help you get started with the package and understand what it does. (There are also corresponding .Rmd files for those of you familiar with Rmarkdown.)
